    <!-- Create a project about whatever you like (or take the one of your HTML challenge), and style all the content with CSS!
You will work in teams of two, so work together on this as much as possible.
#The rules (must have):
no javascript!
no inline styling (all your styles have to be in separate stylesheets)
not two separate projects (This is a team project. If you split responsibilities, somewhere has to be the connection between the two parts.)
style all the content of your page somehow
use flex box somewhere in your project
use at least one font of your choice
use at least one pseudo class ( like hover or active)
Nice to have (optional):
use different ways to select your HTML elements (element, class, descendant,…)
use a CSS variable somewhere
use the BEM naming convention for your CSS
use different units (e.g. rem, vh, %, px, …)
use a media query
do whatever cool things come to your mind - the possibilities of CSS are endless ; ) -->

    "Sorry/not sorry for the simile: This empathy-expanding novel, a sly paeon to the power of great fiction and its ability to be a Trojan horse delivering the truth, is like a pomegranate—open it and you’ll find a treasure trove inside." —Erin Kodicek

        "Power, pleasure, drugs, and violence collide in this page turner with Crazy Rich Asians, Narcos, and The Godfather vibes. From extreme wealth to extreme poverty, and narrated by a cast of characters on both sides of the spectrum, Deepti Kapoor’s juicy novel centers on a sprawling Indian family that controls—or attempts to control—all that’s around them, at any cost." —Al Woodworth    </p>

        "Batten down the hatches, this true story of mayhem and murder, adventure, and reckless ambition on the high seas is a thrill to read. You can almost feel the salt spray on your skin as the HMS Wager and its hurly-burly crew fight the elements and each other in pursuit of fame and fortune. David Grann, once again, has made history come alive." —Al Woodworth

Filled with characters who love deeply and dream big, this novel will sweep you off your feet." —Al Woodworth
